Leftfield mono-repo.

## Getting Started

You'll need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/) to run the projects in this repository.

To work on an application, api, or package project locally, you can `cd ${directory}` into the directory and run the following,

```sh
$ make build
$ make local
```

For applications, you can also opt to to run `make staging`, which will connect the local application to staging backends. This is useful if you just need to make frontend changes.

All projects afford `make test`.
